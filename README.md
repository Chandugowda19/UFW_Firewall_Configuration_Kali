# UFW_Firewall_Configuration_Kali

 Steps Performed
1. Open Firewall Configuration Tool
UFW was used as the firewall configuration tool via terminal in Kali Linux.

sudo ufw status numbered
3. Block Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)
To block Telnet on port 23:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo ufw deny in 23
4. Test the Rule
The rule was tested using Telnet to verify if the port was blocked:

bash
Copy
Edit
telnet localhost 23
5. Allow SSH (Port 22)
To ensure SSH access remains available:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo ufw allow ssh
6. Remove Test Block Rule
